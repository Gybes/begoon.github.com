I'm a native Russian speaker, as the fates decree started to write in English. The majority of my posts were originally written for the <a href="/">Russian version</a> of the blog and then translated into English. I do my best gradually improving my skills in this language. So, I do appreciate any feedback, comments, corrections, or advices.

Also, some of the links (Amazon) on site have my referral id, which provides me with a small commission for each sale. Thank you for your understanding.
