I [tweeted][begoon] recently about a cool case for Raspberry Pi called 
[Pibow][] from Maplin. Alas, despite of my moaning about costliness of this device I have bought it.

How cool is that? Let's check it out. It has arrived:

The parts:

Let's begin its "by slice" composing:

After the first two slices let's put the RPi (remember that it's design
doesn't have even holes for screws):

Now screws and nuts...

Frankly I just love Raspberry Pi. It is difficult to imagine a better device
for schools and universities for studying computers. Only [Maximite][] could
compete if we need a bit more lower level, closer to hardware.

Before my RPi's "case" from [SK Pang][] looked like this:

Incredibly useful device if you need access to GPIO, but as a "normal" case
Pibow is unbeatable.
