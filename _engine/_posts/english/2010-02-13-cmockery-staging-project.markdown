I've launched a project hosting the staging area of the cmockery (the great unit testing framework for C language) â€” [cmockery staging][].

[cmockery staging]: http://code.google.com/p/cmockery-staging/

I will put the latest features and hot bug fixes there, and also merge back the cmockery trunk as well.
