My collection of Intel 8080 microprocessors
===========================================

I started programming twenty year ago coding in machine codes for Intel 8080.
This microprocessor was my lucky pass to the fascinating world of bits and
bytes. Years later developing various emulators of i8080 and tackling with
undocumented and partially documented features of this processor I decided to
collect real chips from different manufacturers and examine them using the
[8080 CPU Exerciser][].

At the moment I have 20 processors (from Intel, AMD, National Semiconductor,
NEC, Samsung, Texas Instruments, and also manufactured in the Soviet Union and
Czechoslovakia). Amongst chips having a year on the label the earliest is
dated back to 1974 and the latest is 1980. All CPUs except one are fully
functional. I tested them on my [Радио-86РК][].

Testing revealed that all processors are identical according to the CPU
Exerciser except clones from AMD. The AMD processors, AM8080 and AM9080A,
behave differently performing the bitwise AND operation (ANA and ANI
instruction). The original Intel CPUs and non-AMD clones set the AC
(half-carry) flag to the value of the 3rd bit (A3) from the bitwise OR between
the accumulator and the argument of ANA or ANI. The AMD clones always zero the
AC flag in the ANA and ANI instructions. I don't know why the original Intel
CPU calculates the AC flag in such a weird way.

AMD

Interestingly, AMD i8080-compatible chips were reverse-engineered from
schematics literally stolen from Intel. So, the Intel vs AMD war began from
8080.

This is how I took pictures of all these chips in a quite technological way
using one iPhone and two Raspberry Pi:

<script>
var images = document.getElementsByTagName("img");
for (var i = 0; i < images.length; ++i) {
  var img = images[i];
  img.ondblclick = function() {
    var url = this.src;
    if (url.indexOf("-top") != -1)
      this.src = url.replace("-top", "-bottom");
    else
      this.src = url.replace("-bottom", "-top");
  }
}
</script>

P.S.

I hope the collection will grow. I still have only one chip in white
ceramic packaging (KR580VM80). If you know i8080 clones from other
manufacturers, which are not listed here, I'd appreciate if you let me know.

If you would like to donate any i8080 chip I'll be happy putting a reference
to you next to the image of the chip.
