This is the first and probably the last non-technical post in this blog. Everything further will be extremely technical about computers, programming, robots etc. The idea was to create a collection of my personal tips and tricks invented or grabbed. Things are being forgotten very quickly, and the online collection might help keeping it at hand. In addition, it's silly to keep ideas under the pillow. Ideas must be shared, and I'm going to do right here.

Follow the announcements.
