I've come back to audiobooks. 40-50 minutes per day when heading an office and then back allow to consume books with decent speed.

A recent.

"The world is flat 3.0: A Brief History of the Twenty-first Century", Thomas L. Friedman

<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0312425074/ref=as_li_tf_il?ie=UTF8&tag=prodiy-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=0312425074"><img border="0" src="http://ws.assoc-amazon.co.uk/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&Format=_SL160_&ASIN=0312425074&MarketPlace=GB&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&tag=prodiy-21&ServiceVersion=20070822" ></a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=prodiy-21&l=as2&o=2&a=0312425074" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

This is a killer book to understand or even discover that nowadays:

* individuals can compete with corporations
* an importance of engineering and especially computer education is increasing enormously
* a number of places on the Earth when you can have decent life doing what you love to do is not narrowed to the US and a few EU countries anymore
* India, China, Russia and many other countries have a very strong position competing with even US now without immigration permanent self education and nurturing your curiosity (CQ + PQ always greater that IQ) is the only way to remain valuable

And many other topics.

Frankly, there were moments in my life when I doubted and thought I would be better off doing, for instance, real estate, natural resources, ads or media rather than software. If you have even a tiny similar concern this book will wipe it out forever, and maybe even show the way.

To conclude: very useful, interesting and fascinating reading.
