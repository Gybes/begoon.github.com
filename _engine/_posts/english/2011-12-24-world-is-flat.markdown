I've come back to audiobooks. 40-50 minutes per day when heading an office and then back allow to consume books with decent speed.

A recent.

"[The world is flat 3.0: A Brief History of the Twenty-first Century][]", Thomas L. Friedman

[The world is flat 3.0: A Brief History of the Twenty-first Century]: http://www.amazon.com/World-Flat-3-0-History-Twenty-first/dp/0312425074/

This is a killer book to understand or even discover that nowadays:

* individuals can compete with corporations
* an importance of engineering and especially computer education is increasing enormously
* a number of places on the Earth when you can have decent life doing what you love to do is not narrowed to the US and a few EU countries anymore
* India, China, Russia and many other countries have a very strong position competing with even US now without immigration
permanent self education and nurturing your curiosity (CQ + PQ always greater that IQ) is the only way to remain valuable

And many other topics.

Frankly, there were moments in my life when I doubted and thought I would be better off doing, for instance, real estate, natural resources, ads or media rather than software. If you have even a tiny similar concern this book will wipe it out forever, and maybe even show the way.

To conclude: very useful, interesting and fascinating reading.
