It turns out that, if, for instance, your Gmail address is `comrade@gmail.com`,
e-mails addressed to `com.rade@gmail.com` or even to `c.o.m.r.a.d.e@gmail.com`
will be delivered to the first address.

It's cool but quite useless. There is another interesting feature. E-mails sent
to the addresses below:

* `comrade+fred@gmail.com`
* `comrade+john@gmail.com`
* `comrade+peter@gmail.com`
...
* `comrade+a_somebodies_name@gmail.com`

will be also delivered to `comrade@gmail.com`. Then it is possible to set
some filtering rules in Gmail redirecting these e-mails to appropriate people
depending on that extra bit in the "From:" address between `+` and `@` symbols.

This may help organizing a free "pseudo" mail server with Gmail.
