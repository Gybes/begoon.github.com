This device allows to connect legacy RS-232 devices to the world of TCP/IP. We used such things years ago developing software for POSes and ATMs. Just change a dialing script from something like `ATDT12345678` to `ATD192.168.1.1` and off you go.

Have no idea what to do with this now. I even have no proper RS-232 port, only via a USB cable. Interestingly, back those days such devices were very expensive.
