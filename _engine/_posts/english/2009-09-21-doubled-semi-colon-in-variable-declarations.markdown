It seems to be completely innocent example (`vs_double_semicolumn.c`):

{% codeblock lang:cpp %}
void main() {
  int a;;
  int b;
}
{% endcodeblock %}

Compile (in ะก mode, there is no `/TP`):

    cl vs_double_semicolumn.c

The result:

    vs_double_semicolumn.c
    vs_double_semicolumn.c(3) : error C2143: syntax error : missing ';' before 'type'
    The result of Codegear/Borland is roughly the same (though the error message is more clear):
    CodeGear C++ 5.93 for Win32 Copyright (c) 1993, 2007 CodeGear
    vs_double_semicolumn.c:
    Error E2140 vs_double_semicolumn.c 3: Declaration is not allowed here in function main
    *** 1 errors in Compile ***

The problem hides behind the accidental typo of the double `;` character. By the way this example is absolutely real from life. Just one misprint raises a lot of questions.

It turns out that the second `;` character is treated as an empty statement but not as an empty declaration of a variable. The compiler decides that declarations of variables are finished and a block of statements begins, therefore it reasonably complains on the `b` declaration expecting statements.

I've checked it on gcc and native compilers of AIX, Solaris and HP-UX. All of those have eaten this example without any problems.
