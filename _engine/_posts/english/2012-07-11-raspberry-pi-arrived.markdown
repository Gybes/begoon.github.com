After a few months of waiting and agiotage it finally arrived. I have dived again into a wonderful world on fiddling with kernels, patches, firmware, a bit of soldering, forums and blogs, trying to explore this wonderful piece of hardware. 

I suspect there will be series of blog posts about Raspberry Pi.

Frankly, even before receiving my own RPi I already had to solder the SD socket on another RPi which was broken. There is a rumor spreading that this type of SD sockets is very unreliable.

In contrast I cannot complain at all about an SD socket used in [Maximite][Maximite - 8-bit nostalgia with a soldering] but it was a different type.
