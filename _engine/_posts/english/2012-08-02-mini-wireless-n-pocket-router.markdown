Quite often in hotel rooms you can only find Ethernet. But what am I supposed to do with iPhone and iPad then? So, I bought this tiny little device some time ago:

Unfortunately, I haven't met a hotel with properly installed WiFi coverage. Many can put a cable, but proper WiFi coverage with decent speed -- no one. But this device makes you an ad-hoc instant router in minutes with no pain whatsoever.

P.S. By the way, a question -- is WiFi hardware (chipset) in laptops, for instance, and regular WiFi access points different in any way? If the connection is duplex, it shouldn't be. So, how to turn a laptop into a proper WiFi access point then? I tried things like [Connectify](http://connectify.me/) on Windows 7, but it didn't really work properly. And what should I also do on Linux and OSX?
