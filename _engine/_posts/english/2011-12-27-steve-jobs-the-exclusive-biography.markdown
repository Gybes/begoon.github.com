I thought that biographies are for "old people". This book has changed that mindset in me. Being driven by massive ads and recently emerged love with Apple products and philosophy I had started reading.

Initially it was like an expanded version of "[Pirates of Silicon Valley][]" which I, frankly, liked, but as reading progressed I had just fallen in love with this book and weren't able to stop.

[Pirates of Silicon Valley]: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0168122/

The book can be treated as conjuncture or just an attempt to leverage the situation that Steve has just passed away. I was fully biased but after the first chapter I was hooked.

It is fascinating reading. Maybe just because the author is talented, I don't know.

Conclusion: strongly recommend.
