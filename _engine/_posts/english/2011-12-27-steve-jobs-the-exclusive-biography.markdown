I thought that biographies are for "old people". This book has changed that mindset in me. Being driven by massive ads and recently emerged love with Apple products and philosophy I had started reading.

Initially it was like an expanded version of "[Pirates of Silicon Valley][]" which I, frankly, liked, but as reading progressed I had just fallen in love with this book and weren't able to stop.

The book can be treated as conjuncture or just an attempt to leverage the situation that Steve has just passed away. I was fully biased but after the first chapter I was hooked.

It is fascinating reading. Maybe just because the author is talented, I don't know.

Conclusion: strongly recommend.
