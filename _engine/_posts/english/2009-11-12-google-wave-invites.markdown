I have a dozen of invites to Google Wave.

I could send it off to all interested in the order of requests. Naturally it is relevant only if you have a Gmail account. So please please indicate an address at Gmail to send the invitation.

Please be patient because after the invitation is sent it could take a couple of days until you get it.

And one more thing -- share your own invitations because Wave is cool where there are many people in it.
