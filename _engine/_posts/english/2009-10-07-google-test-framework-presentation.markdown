Following up to the [post about the new version of Google Test][Google C++ Testing Framework 1.4.0], there is the presentation available from its developers:

[Google C++ Testing Framework 1.4.0]: /blog/english/2009/10/03/google-test-framework-140/

They cover not only the framework itself and samples of using it but also there is a couple of words about the test driven development methodology. There are some basic recommendations given for writing testable code.

In whole it would be not worse ten minutes to have a look and give it some thoughts.
