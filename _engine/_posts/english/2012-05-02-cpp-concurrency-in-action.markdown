I managed to attend [ACCU 2012][] this year. It was almost all about C++ 2011. One of the presentations I have attended was "C++11 concurrency tutorial" from [Anthony Williams][]. He is, no more no less, the maintainer of boost::thread.

[ACCU 2012]: http://accu.org/index.php/conferences/accu_conference_2012
[Anthony Williams]: http://www.boost.org/users/people/anthony_williams.html

His presentation is [available][C++11 concurrency tutorial slides] with [examples][C++11 concurrency tutorial samples].

[C++11 concurrency tutorial samples]: http://www.justsoftwaresolutions.co.uk/files/c++11_concurrency_code.zip

Unfortunately, I missed his second presentation, "Dataflow, Actors and High Level Structures in Concurrent Applications". In fact, it was about implementing the concept of actors, similar as in Erlang, in C++ 2011.

This presentation is also [available][Dataflow, Actors and High Level Structures in Concurrent Applications slides] with [examples][Dataflow, Actors and High Level Structures in Concurrent Applications samples].

Recommend.

Going further. Anthony's book, "C++ Concurrency in Action", has been released recently.

If you want an exhaustive explanation about the C++ memory model, please read the chapters 5 (along with all others).
