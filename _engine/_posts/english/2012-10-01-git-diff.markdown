Problem: Get code statistics -- a number of added and deleted lines of code,
for instance, across annual releases. Git does straightaway
via [git diff][].

[git diff]: http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-diff.html

    git diff --shortstat rel-2010 rel-2011

It prints something like this:

    12 files changed, 2462 insertions(+), 488 deletions(-)

If your project isn't in git, you can quickly import the branches you want
to analyse in a temporary git repo.
