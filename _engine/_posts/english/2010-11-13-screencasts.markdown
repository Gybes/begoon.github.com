Do you watch screencasts?

I've discovered this way of getting technical information for myself only recently. Impression is only positive so far - the perceptual speed is much faster comparing to reading.

For example, after [Coding in Objective-C 2.0][] I can write a program in this language using classes and have an idea how the memory management works in Objective-C (by the way, it's quite interesting concept - a "manual" garbage collector when memory is freed automatically but the programmer has to manage the counter of active links to an object by himself.

Currently watching [Writing Your First iPhone Application][] and the next is [Erlang in Practice][].

[Erlang in Practice]: http://www.pragprog.com/screencasts/v-kserl/erlang-in-practice

This is a delicate moment with screencasts - it should be made qualitatively. Otherwise it's waste of time.

Which screencasts do you watch? What can you recommend?

P.S. By the way, I like [The pragmatic Bookshelf][] online store more and more. All books are in multiple DRM free formats (pdf, mobi, epub).
