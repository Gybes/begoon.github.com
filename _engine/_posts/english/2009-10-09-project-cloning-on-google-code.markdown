Last day Mercurial repositories on Google Code were read-only due to maintenance works.

I have come over today and see this:

There is a new item in the Source tab — Close (in red). This is what we have been waiting for a long time — project cloning.

If an owner of some project does not want to make you as a contributor but you are desperately keen to show off your work on the project, you can simply clone it and keep going to work on your own fork. Entire history of an original project will be fully inherited. 

A clone can be cloned as well.
