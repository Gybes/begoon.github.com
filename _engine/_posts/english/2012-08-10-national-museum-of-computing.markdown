[Last time][Enigma, Colossus, or the history of British cryptography] I wasn't able to get into [The National Museum of Computing][], so this time I had double checked their open hours, and -- I'm going in.

Below there is a bunch of photos of things which had caught my eye. Of course, there is much more stuff in the museum.

Have you seen The Matrix? Remember the modem they used for teleportation?

I'd be surprised if there isn't Raspberry Pi in the British museum, so here it is.

Oh, I should probably buy this one and relax.

Brothers! Fasten your seat belts. This is the **whole** room of **working** BBC Micros. Books and manuals are ready to help. You can sit and program.

Go to a middle heavy weight. Now floor-standing machines instead of desktops.

An analog computer. In digital computers we break down tasks into primitive binary operations. In analog computers we have to use operational amplifiers to add, subtract, integrate or differentiate electrical signals.

Brothers! This is just awesome, the must see place for computer enthusiasts. Unfortunately, I had only forty minutes for everything, so maybe I'll go there once again.
