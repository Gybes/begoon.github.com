Programmers love "magic" numbers, numbers having second, often verbal, meaning. The hexadecimal digits suit perfectly here.

For instance, to form a stub number for a 16- or 32-bit value, people usually use words from the following set:

    ABBE
    ACED
    BABE
    BADE
    BEAD
    BEEF
    BODE
    CADE
    CAFE
    CEDE
    COCA
    CODA
    CODE
    DACE
    DADO
    DEAD
    DEAF
    DECO
    DEED
    DODO
    FACE
    FADE
    FEED
    FOOD
    OBOE

For example:

    DEADFACE
    ACEDFEED  

If we don't care about the symmetrical split, the vocabulary is a bit wider:

    ABBE
    ABE
    ABODE
    ACCEDE
    ACCEDED
    ACE
    ACED
    ADD
    ADDED
    ADO
    ADOBE
    BAA
    BABE
    BAD
    BADE
    BAOBAB
    BE
    BEAD
    BEADED
    BED
    BEDDED
    BEE
    BEEF
    BOA
    BOB
    BOBBED
    BODE
    BODED
    BOO
    BOOBOO
    BOOED
    CAB
    CACAO
    CAD
    CADE
    CAFE
    CEDE
    CEDED
    COB
    COCA
    COCOA
    COD
    CODA
    CODE
    CODED
    COFFEE
    COO
    COOED
    DAB
    DABBED
    DACE
    DAD
    DADO
    DEAD
    DEAF
    DEB
    DECADE
    DECAF
    DECO
    DECODE
    DECODED
    DEE
    DEED
    DEFACE
    DEFACED
    DO
    DOC
    DODO
    DOE
    DOFFED
    EBB
    EBBED
    EFFACE
    EFFACED
    FAB
    FACADE
    FACE
    FACED
    FAD
    FADE
    FADED
    FED
    FEE
    FEED
    FOB
    FOBBED
    FOE
    FOOD
    OAF
    OBOE
    ODD
    ODE
    OF
    OFF

For example:

    BADCOCOA
    BADCODED
    FADEDDOC
    CODEDBOB

On 64-bit systems we can create almost complete sentences. 

    EBBEDDEADBAOBAB
    
Does anybody know what to say to the next, 128-bit generation?
